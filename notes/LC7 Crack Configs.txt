NOTES:


So.. should the default techniques be proper for the hash types?

No, just do a quick hash verify before hitting start that checks LM only or NTLM only or both and informs the user of what is going to happen

making charset:
	../run/john -make-charset=../run/ascii.chr -pot:rockyou.ansi.pot -ext:filter_ascii
