Release Candidate 4
-------------------

Hello Beta Testers!

Changes from RC3a:

Documentation is now included.
Import hardened with more information when a failure occurs.
Added challenge/response hash importing for sniffers, off by default but can be turned on in the settings menu.
Changing some system settings required restarting LC7, it now prompts to do so.

Thanks, and happy testing!
